Exercise(s) Identify an artefact or system that we are familiar with today. Reverse it in pseudo developmental stages… Example: MorphoPrototyping:

1. Identify an artefact or system.

1. Identify the ‘features’ of that artefact or system

1. Imagine that the artefact ‘developed’ as if it were a biological organism

1. Identify when the artefact ‘expressed’ these features by working out pseudo developmental stages for the artefact.

1. Imagine there are genes that trigger the expression of the features.

1. Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product).
