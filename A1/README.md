### Paragraph for each future near mid and far (you will use these to generate needs in A2)

**H1** \
Roskilde Festival made a change in its overall theme this year and moved over to more pop concerts as opposed to the usual genre of Rock music. This also brought a different atmosphere resulting in more intimate concerts which wasn’t scheduled. This is likely to develop further in the next few years.

**H2** \
Roskilde Festival looks to the attendants for feedback on existing areas and performances. By drawing on the experience and feedback of the attendees of the festival, Roskilde Festival wishes to improve its current offers to the festival guests. These offers can be everything from protection from climate to more cultural offers or more diverse cultural offers to be implemented on the festival.

**H3** \
Other festivals have been closed due to bad weather – often flooding and rainstorms. The Danish weather is often rainy and/or windy which seems to worsen in the future. The temperature is at the same time rising globally which affects Denmark as well so the weather could also be warmer than in the past years even though Denmark is generally a chilly country.

Examples of other festivals: \
Burning Man (2023) – Mud chaos due to heavy rain. \
Sled Island, Canada (2013) – The city was flooded overnight. \
Glastonbury (2005) – Torrential rain and flash floods. \
TommorowWorld (2015) – Horrendous weather.
