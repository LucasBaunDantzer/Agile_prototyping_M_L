### Paragraph for each future near mid and far (you will use these to generate needs in A2)

**H1** \
Roskilde Festival made a change in its overall theme this year and moved over to more pop concerts as opposed to the usual genre of Rock music. This also brought a different atmosphere resulting in more intimate concerts which wasn’t scheduled. This is likely to develop further in the next few years.

**H2** \
Roskilde Festival looks to the attendants for feedback on existing areas and performances. By drawing on the experience and feedback of the attendees of the festival, Roskilde Festival wishes to improve its current offers to the festival guests. These offers can be everything from protection from climate to more cultural offers or more diverse cultural offers to be implemented on the festival.

**H3** \
Other festivals have been closed due to bad weather – often flooding and rainstorms. The Danish weather is often rainy and/or windy which seems to worsen in the future. The temperature is at the same time rising globally which affects Denmark as well so the weather could also be warmer than in the past years even though Denmark is generally a chilly country.

Examples of other festivals: \
Burning Man (2023) – Mud chaos due to heavy rain. \
Sled Island, Canada (2013) – The city was flooded overnight. \
Glastonbury (2005) – Torrential rain and flash floods. \
TommorowWorld (2015) – Horrendous weather.


### A timeline diagram that tells us the year of the 3 futures

### Project Selection and justification

The choice of the project will be the Roskilde Pavilion specifically focused on use at the Roskilde Festival. In recent years many issues regarding climate problems have arisen in general and for festivals worldwide. We want to make a small contribution to tackling some of the future challenges close to home while still fulfilling the desired needs for the pavilion.

### Gene System focus with justification

The main focus will be on the pavilion's function with a sub-focus on material and build. We are mainly looking at the functions of the pavilion as it is important that it will be used during the festival and that it is possible to reuse it and even improve the pavilion or adapt it from year to year based on future needs. It is almost certain that material shortage will come even more so than what it currently is. Thus, a sub-focus of our project will be on material selection and the building process as well as the disassembly process of the pavilion.

### System Selection

We are focusing on three systems of the pavilion itself to fulfill requirements that will arise from the gene system focus. These systems will be assembly/joints, the exterior/skin, and the platform on which the users will stand.

### Planet A or B focus with justification

The focus of the project will be Planet A as the climate on our current planet is ever-changing. This poses many challenges to open-air festivals such as the Roskilde Festival already. Many festivals have already been challenged by climate issues and these need robust solutions that are adaptable for the future. Further, festivals are always changing and adapting to the attendee's needs/wants, which makes for interesting solution proposals for future festivals.
