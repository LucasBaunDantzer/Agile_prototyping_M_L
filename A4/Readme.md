## User interactions and feature expression
The first user to interact with our pavilion will be the team that needs to package the pavilion in the container as well as the team assembling the pavilion on site. Our pavilion is made to be easy to assemble, the hardest part comes from drilling ground plugs into the ground which will be the basis of the pavilion that will support the entire structure. On top of the ground plugs, three-way connectors with rubber rings will be mounted and on these three-way connectors, the bamboo pipes can be inserted. The ground plugs and bamboo pipes are meant to be bought from a hardware store whereas the three-way connectors are meant to be 3D printed at DTU to fit the sizes of the bamboo pipes and have the correct angles. \
When the pavilion is assembled with the structural parts fabric canvases can be fitted inside the hexagonal shapes of the pavilion to provide shade, but these can also be decorated with logos or messages that the pavilion wishes to communicate to people passing by and users. This will add to our feature of getting feedback from the users through some of the messages printed on the canvases. \
When using the honeycomb structure, a rather large structure can be created since the individual elements of the bamboo pipes won’t be too long to fit inside the container. Thus, the pavilion can be adjusted in size to fit different purposes from small concerts to a more intimate smaller function.

## User behavior change or AP change
To fully utilize the feedback feature of the pavilion we will need users to be a bit more outgoing and make an outreach themselves after spotting the messages of the pavilion. However, we believe our pavilion should also change from year to year to adapt the needs and the feedback of the users to make it both easier to get future feedback but also to deliver a better experience for the users. \

## Reverse engineering utilization

## Full-scale model link to prototype
Our prototype is a simple one made in the software Grasshopper which will make it easy to try out different sizing of the pavilion and the hexagonal shape. Through this model, we can calculate the angles for the three-way connectors, and this will be the direct link to the full-scale model. \
Trying out different messages on the canvases will need to be done through testing on-site at the festival or on a temporary site where a lot of people pass by to see the reactions to the messages. The test of the messages can also be done through online surveys however the effect is not deemed to be the same as with a physical test. \

## Issues generated by our AP
Our agile prototype doesn’t seem to be generating any issues by itself however the users of the pavilion could generate future issues. As we are in a world where a lot of people easily get offended, the messages of the pavilion could end up offending people which would create issues for the users, the pavilion, and maybe even the festival itself depending on the message. Thus, it is important when having such a large canvas that might be very impactful to have thought about what needs to be communicated. \
